## What is Chalawa?

Chalawa is a JavaScript/TypeScript library that helps you **encrypt data safely** when sending it over the internet. Think of it like putting your data in a locked box before sending it to someone else.

**Why do we need this?**
- When you send data over the internet, hackers can intercept it
- Chalawa scrambles (encrypts) your data so only the intended recipient can read it
- It provides two ways to do this: simple password-based encryption and advanced key exchange

## Core Concepts

### üîê Encryption vs Decryption
- **Encryption**: Converting readable text into scrambled text that looks like gibberish
- **Decryption**: Converting the scrambled text back into readable text
- **Key/Password**: The secret needed to encrypt and decrypt data

### üîë Two Methods of Encryption

**Method 1: Password-Based (Simple)**
- Both sender and receiver know the same password
- Like having a shared key to the same lock
- Simpler but requires sharing passwords securely

**Method 2: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (Advanced)**
- Creates a shared secret without transmitting it
- Like two people creating a secret code without telling anyone else what it is
- More secure for internet communications

## File-by-File Breakdown

### 1. `src/types.ts` - Data Structure Definitions

**What it does:** Defines what our data should look like (TypeScript types)

**Simple explanation:** Think of this as creating templates or forms that say "this function needs these specific pieces of information."

```typescript
// Example: This says "to encrypt something, I need text and a password"
export type EncryptionInput = {
    plainText: string,    // The text you want to encrypt
    password: string      // The password to use
}
```

**All the types defined:**
- `EncryptionInput` - What you need for basic encryption
- `DecryptionInput` - What you need for basic decryption
- `DHKeyPair` - A pair of keys (one private, one public) for advanced encryption
- `DHSharedSecretInput` - What you need to create a shared secret
- And more...

### 2. `src/encryption.ts` - Basic Password Encryption

**What it does:** Takes your readable text and scrambles it using a password

**How it works step by step:**
1. Takes your text and password
2. Creates a random "salt" (called IV - Initialization Vector)
3. Uses a mathematical process (SHA-512) to strengthen the password
4. Uses AES-256-GCM encryption (military-grade encryption) to scramble the text
5. Packages everything together in a special format

**Simple analogy:** Like putting a letter in a lockbox, then putting that lockbox in another lockbox, then giving you a special coded address to find it.

```typescript
export function encrypt({ plainText, password }: EncryptionInput): string {
    // Creates a random number for extra security
    const iv = randomBytes(16);
    
    // Strengthens the password using math
    const hash = createHash('sha512');
    const dataKey = hash.update(password, 'utf-8');
    const genHash = dataKey.digest('hex');
    const key = genHash.substring(0,32);
    
    // Does the actual encryption
    const cipher = createCipheriv('aes-256-gcm', Buffer.from(key), iv);
    let encrypted = cipher.update(plainText, 'utf-8', 'base64');
    encrypted += cipher.final('base64');
    const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();
    
    // Packages everything together
    return encrypted + ":" + Buffer.from(iv).toString('base64') + ":" + authTag.toString('base64');
}
```

### 3. `src/decryption.ts` - Basic Password Decryption

**What it does:** Takes scrambled text and unscrambles it using the same password

**How it works:**
1. Takes the encrypted text (which has three parts separated by colons)
2. Splits it into: encrypted data, IV (random number), and auth tag (verification)
3. Recreates the same key from the password
4. Reverses the encryption process
5. Returns the original readable text

**Important:** The password must be EXACTLY the same as used for encryption

```typescript
export function decrypt({ encryptedText, password }: DecryptionInput) {
    // Split the encrypted text into its parts
    let result = encryptedText.split(":");
    if (result.length !== 3) {
        throw new Error('Invalid encrypted text format');
    }
    
    // Recreate the same key from password
    let m = createHash('sha512');
    let dataKey = m.update(password, 'utf-8');
    let genHash = dataKey.digest('hex');
    let key = genHash.substring(0, 32);
    
    // Get all the pieces
    let iv = Buffer.from(result[1], 'base64');
    let authTag = Buffer.from(result[2], 'base64');
    
    // Decrypt the data
    let decipher = createDecipheriv('aes-256-gcm', Buffer.from(key), iv);
    decipher.setAuthTag(authTag);
    let decrypted = decipher.update(result[0], 'base64', 'utf-8');
    decrypted += decipher.final('utf-8');
    
    return JSON.parse(decrypted);
}
```

### 4. `src/diffie-hellman.ts` - Advanced Key Exchange

**What it does:** Creates a way for two people to agree on a secret without anyone else knowing

**Real-world analogy:** Imagine two people who want to create a secret color:
1. They agree on a common color (yellow)
2. Each person secretly picks their own color (red and blue)
3. Each mixes their secret color with the common color
4. They exchange these mixed colors publicly
5. Each adds their original secret color to the received mixture
6. Both end up with the same final color (brown), but no observer knows what it is

**In code terms:**
- Uses mathematical formulas instead of colors
- Creates "key pairs" (one private key you keep secret, one public key you can share)
- Both parties can calculate the same shared secret

```typescript
export function generateDHKeyPair({ password }: DHKeyExchangeInput = {}): DHKeyPair {
    // Create a new Diffie-Hellman instance with predefined safe numbers
    const dh = createDiffieHellman(PRIME_2048, 'hex', GENERATOR);
    dh.generateKeys();
    
    let privateKey = dh.getPrivateKey();
    let publicKey = dh.getPublicKey();
    
    // If password provided, add extra security
    if (password) {
        const hash = createHash('sha256');
        const passwordHash = hash.update(password + Date.now().toString()).digest();
        
        const enhancedHash = createHash('sha256');
        enhancedHash.update(privateKey);
        enhancedHash.update(passwordHash);
        const enhancedPrivateKey = enhancedHash.digest();
        
        const enhancedDH = createDiffieHellman(PRIME_2048, 'hex', GENERATOR);
        enhancedDH.setPrivateKey(enhancedPrivateKey);
        enhancedDH.generateKeys();
        
        return {
            privateKey: enhancedPrivateKey.toString('hex'),
            publicKey: enhancedDH.getPublicKey().toString('hex')
        };
    }
    
    return {
        privateKey: privateKey.toString('hex'),
        publicKey: publicKey.toString('hex')
    };
}
```

### 5. `src/dh-encryption.ts` - Encryption Using Shared Secrets

**What it does:** Uses the shared secret from Diffie-Hellman to encrypt/decrypt data

**Why this is better than passwords:**
- No need to share passwords over the internet
- Each conversation can have a unique secret
- Even if someone intercepts everything, they can't figure out the secret

**How it works:** Very similar to basic encryption, but instead of using a password to create the key, it uses the shared secret from Diffie-Hellman.

### 6. `src/index.ts` - The Main Entry Point

**What it does:** This is like a directory or index that tells other programs what functions are available

```typescript
export * from "./encryption";      // Makes encrypt() available
export * from "./decryption";      // Makes decrypt() available
export * from "./diffie-hellman";  // Makes DH functions available
export * from "./dh-encryption";   // Makes DH encrypt/decrypt available
export * from "./types";           // Makes all types available
```

**Simple explanation:** When someone installs and imports Chalawa, this file determines what functions they can use.

## How Everything Works Together

### Scenario 1: Simple Communication
```
1. Alice and Bob agree on a password: "secret123"
2. Alice encrypts her message: encrypt({plainText: "Hello Bob", password: "secret123"})
3. Alice sends the encrypted result to Bob
4. Bob decrypts it: decrypt({encryptedText: received, password: "secret123"})
5. Bob sees "Hello Bob"
```

### Scenario 2: Secure Communication (Diffie-Hellman)
```
1. Alice creates keys: generateDHKeyPair() ‚Üí {privateKey: "alice_private", publicKey: "alice_public"}
2. Bob creates keys: generateDHKeyPair() ‚Üí {privateKey: "bob_private", publicKey: "bob_public"}
3. They exchange public keys over the internet
4. Alice computes secret: computeSharedSecret({privateKey: "alice_private", otherPublicKey: "bob_public"})
5. Bob computes secret: computeSharedSecret({privateKey: "bob_private", otherPublicKey: "alice_public"})
6. Both have the same secret, but nobody else knows it!
7. They use dhEncrypt() and dhDecrypt() with this shared secret
```

## Security Concepts Explained

### üõ°Ô∏è AES-256-GCM
- **AES**: Advanced Encryption Standard (the encryption method)
- **256**: Uses 256-bit keys (extremely strong)
- **GCM**: Galois/Counter Mode (provides authentication - ensures data hasn't been tampered with)

### üîê SHA-512
- A "hash function" that converts any input into a fixed-length output
- Like a mathematical blender that scrambles data in a predictable way
- Used to strengthen passwords before using them as encryption keys

### üé≤ Initialization Vector (IV)
- A random number used to make each encryption unique
- Even if you encrypt the same text with the same password twice, the result will be different
- Prevents pattern recognition attacks

### üè∑Ô∏è Authentication Tag
- A special code that proves the encrypted data hasn't been tampered with
- Like a seal on an envelope that breaks if someone tries to open it

### üîí Perfect Forward Secrecy
- Even if someone steals your long-term keys, they can't decrypt past conversations
- Each session uses temporary keys that are thrown away afterward

## Usage Patterns

### For Simple Applications
```typescript
import { encrypt, decrypt } from 'chalawa';

// Encrypt sensitive data before storing or transmitting
const userData = { userId: 123, email: 'user@example.com' };
const encrypted = encrypt({
    plainText: JSON.stringify(userData),
    password: process.env.SECRET_PASSWORD
});

// Later, decrypt when needed
const decrypted = decrypt({
    encryptedText: encrypted,
    password: process.env.SECRET_PASSWORD
});
```

### For Client-Server Applications
```typescript
import { generateDHKeyPair, computeSharedSecret, dhEncrypt, dhDecrypt } from 'chalawa';

// Client side
const clientKeys = generateDHKeyPair();
// Send clientKeys.publicKey to server

// Server side  
const serverKeys = generateDHKeyPair();
const sharedSecret = computeSharedSecret({
    privateKey: serverKeys.privateKey,
    otherPublicKey: clientKeys.publicKey
});

// Now both can encrypt/decrypt with the shared secret
const encryptedMessage = dhEncrypt({
    plainText: JSON.stringify({ action: 'transfer', amount: 1000 }),
    sharedSecret: sharedSecret
});
```

### For Enhanced Security
```typescript
// Use both DH and passwords for maximum security
const keys = generateDHKeyPair({ password: 'additional-entropy' });
const sharedSecret = computeSharedSecret({
    privateKey: keys.privateKey,
    otherPublicKey: otherPartyPublicKey,
    password: 'shared-enhancement-password'
});
```

## Common Questions

### ‚ùì Why are there two different encryption methods?

**Password-based encryption** is simpler but requires both parties to know the same password. This can be challenging to do securely over the internet.

**Diffie-Hellman encryption** allows two parties to create a shared secret without ever transmitting it. This is much safer for internet communications.

### ‚ùì What happens if I lose the password or keys?

The encrypted data becomes unrecoverable. This is by design - if it were easy to recover, it wouldn't be secure. Always back up your passwords/keys safely.

### ‚ùì Can I use this in a web browser?

Yes! The library is designed to work in Node.js environments. For browsers, you might need additional configuration, but the core concepts remain the same.

### ‚ùì How secure is this really?

Very secure when used correctly:
- Uses military-grade AES-256 encryption
- Implements proper authentication to prevent tampering
- Follows industry best practices for key derivation
- Uses well-tested cryptographic primitives from Node.js

### ‚ùì What's the performance like?

Encryption/decryption is very fast for typical data sizes. Diffie-Hellman key generation is slower but only needs to be done once per session.

### ‚ùì Can I trust this code?

The code uses Node.js's built-in crypto module, which is based on OpenSSL - one of the most trusted cryptographic libraries in the world. The implementation follows standard practices and includes comprehensive tests.

## Final Notes

This codebase provides a solid foundation for secure data transmission. The key principles are:

1. **Defense in depth**: Multiple layers of security
2. **Industry standards**: Uses well-established cryptographic methods
3. **Flexibility**: Supports both simple and advanced use cases
4. **Transparency**: All code is readable and well-documented

Remember: Cryptography is complex, and this documentation simplifies many concepts. The actual mathematical operations are handled by proven libraries, so you can focus on using the tools correctly rather than implementing the math yourself.

For production use, always:
- Use HTTPS for all network communications
- Store passwords/keys securely
- Regularly rotate keys and passwords
- Test your implementation thoroughly
- Keep the library updated
